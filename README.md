# BattleShipsGame
The Battleships Game is a classic two-player strategy game where each player tries to sink their opponent's fleet of ships by guessing their positions on a grid. In this C++ version, the game is played via the command prompt, where players take turns to input their guesses, and the system provides feedback on whether the shot was a hit or a miss. The game ends when one player's entire fleet is sunk.

The game contains:
- A game mode in which you can play with a friend on the same computer
- A game mode where you can play with the computer
- A leaderboard where you can see your won, lost or tied games
